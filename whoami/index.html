I&rsquo;m currently pursuing a Master&rsquo;s degree (Bac+5) at École 2600, specializing in Web (mostly), OSINT and Forensics.

After several years in the culinary field, I took some time to reconsider my career. This reflection led me to the IT industry, starting with a bootcamp that ultimately helped me secure a role as a web developer. My previous career taught me to approach problems with a critical mindset, carefully assessing potential repercussions and security implications (surprisingly similar to the rigorous safety and certification standards required in professional kitchens). This mindset naturally drew me deeper into cybersecurity during my time as a web developer, leading me directly into the infosec field."><meta name=keywords content="ctf,hacking,cybersecurity,writeups,web,osint,forensic,crypto"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Whoami"><meta name=twitter:description content="Blog Link to heading Welcome to my blog!
